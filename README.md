# EtchASketch
Etch-A-Sketch JS Project From The Odin Project

This project combines several Javascript fundamentals that I have been learning recently. 
    - Functions
    - For loops
    - If/else statements
    - Variable scope

It was a deep dive into DOM manipulation and was my first time using Javascript to set content that changes based on user input.
